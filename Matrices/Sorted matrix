Given a n x n matrix. The problem is to sort the given matrix in strict order. Here strict order means that matrix is sorted in a way such that all elements in a row are sorted in increasing order and for row ‘i’, where 1 <= i <= n-1, first element of row 'i' is greater than or equal to the last element of row 'i-1'.


Examples:
Input : mat[][] = { {5, 4, 7},
                    {1, 3, 8},
                    {2, 9, 6} }
Output : 1 2 3
         4 5 6
         7 8 9
         
class Solution:
    def sortedMatrix(self,N,Mat):
        #code here
        l=[]
        for i in range(0,N):
           for j in range(0,N):
              l.append(Mat[i][j])

        l.sort()
        index=0
        for i in range(0,N):
           for j in range(0,N):
              Mat[i][j]=l[index]
              index=index+1

        return Mat
